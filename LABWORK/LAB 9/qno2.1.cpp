/*
2. You are working on a library management system. Your task is to
implement two classes, Book and Library, such that the libraryâ€™s member
function becomes a friend function of Book. Class Book represents a book
in the library. It has private data members for the book's title, author, and
book ID. Class Library represents the library itself. It has an array to store
Book objects and a member function called 'displayBookDetails' that takes
a Book object as input and displays its details.
Your task is to implement the classes and their member functions so that
'displayBookDetails' in Library becomes a friend function of Book,
allowing it to access the private data members of the Book and display its
details.
