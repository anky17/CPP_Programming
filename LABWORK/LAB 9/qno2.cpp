/*You are working on a library management system. Your task is to implement two classes, Book and Library, such that the libraryâ€™s member
function becomes a friend function of Book. Class Book represents a book in the library. It has private data members for the book's title,
author, and book ID. Class Library represents the library itself. It has an array to store Book objects and a member function called
'displayBookDetails' that takes a Book object as input and displays its details. Your task is to implement the classes and their member functions
so that 'displayBookDetails' in Library becomes a friend function of Book, allowing it to access the private data members of the Book and display
its details.*/
